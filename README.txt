This project includes four HTML file, two CSS files, and three image files.
The HTML file is the main file that contains the structure of the web page.
The two CSS files contain the styling for the web page.
The image files are used in the HTML file.

HTML file: index.html, Introduction.html, Fucture.html, Reason.html
Purpose: The HTML file provides the structure for the web page, including the header, navigation, main content, and footer.

Relative paths:
- The favicon images are located in the same directory as the HTML file.
- The common.css file is located in a subdirectory named "css".
- The index.css file is located in the same subdirectory as the HTML file.
- The voice.m4a file is located in a subdirectory named "audio".
- The Introduction.html, Reason.html, and Future.html files are located in the same directory as the HTML file.

CSS files: common.css and index.css
Purpose: The CSS files provide the styling for the web page.

Image files: favicon-32x32.png, favicon-96x96.png, and favicon-16x16.png
Purpose: The image files are used as icons in the browser tab.

Dependent code structures:
- The CSS files use classes and IDs defined in the HTML file to apply styles to specific elements.
- The HTML file uses the audio and form elements, which require specific attributes and tags to function correctly.
- The function showTime is used to display the current time in real-time.
- The function turncolors is used to change the background color of a webpage when the user clicks the change color button. 

All the additional CSS that was required for part3 was placed in the "index.css" file.
I have reused code from A1 or A2.
