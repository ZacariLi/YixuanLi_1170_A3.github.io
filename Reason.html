            <h1>Why I chose DAO to achieve my goal</h1>
            <p>Because I think this is a direction of the future development of the network, from the very beginning of the web1 we can only read can not write on it or publish articles, videos, etc., we want to get information can only be conveyed to us through the television station, which is a very centralized performance, because it is they focus on all the information and then integrated and then conveyed to us. Accordingly, our access to information is very single and very slow.</p>

            <p>But by web 2.0 we can not only read, we can also write, so gradually there is Facebook, insgram, YouTube, etc., we can comment on it, but also can post videos, no longer rely on the central media, which to some extent removed some centralization.</p>
            <a href="https://www.freshconsulting.com/insights/blog/whats-the-difference-between-web1-web2-and-web3/#:~:text=Web1%20is%20a%20web%20of,linking%20users%20to%20each%20other." target="_blank">Web1.0 and Web2.0</a>
            <br>
            <p>So my opinion is that the development of the network is bound to be more and more decentralized.</p>
